Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I think phone policy at school should not let students use their phone during class or free time. For several reasons. First, school has to be an area of education and not of free time. Because in my point of view its a distraction to your self and the people around you. Second, phones could get stolen by the people you don't get along with. Also, another reason for school policy to know is that it can cause drama between friends and also people you don't know. Finally , phones can cause cheating, cheating is what school doesn't want so that's one of my main reasons why i don't want phones being used in school hours,
