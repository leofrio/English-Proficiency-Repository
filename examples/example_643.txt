Art classes are importants for some people but not all students want to take this class they could be doing something that they would like to do,such sports,science and many other classes. Students do not see art as a big deal this days,they do not see a lot of outcome from art classes,is to hard to have a carrear coming from art,really hard to be successful in the art market,art can be that important in the students life. Do something cool or nice to do its the best thing,if the person do not like the class,will be a big chance of the student try to skip class, walking around the school wasting time, a time that they could be using to do something that they would like to do,problems with teachers can happen if they do not agree to do the work in class. This can affect the student in so many ways,and nobody want to see a student not happy with what he is doing at school,this just do not take the student time but also the teacher's time to teach who wants to learn something in the class. Those are real problems that happens in every schools,so to avoid this problems i think art class should be elective.
