What would be you'r lesson to elementary students be? If I was asked to share a lesson to elementary it would be not to cheat. That lesson is important because the students could get into big trouble, show what they don't know, and loose their teachers trust.

First, If a student does cheat they could get in big trouble. One, they could get a zero on the test, and a zero on a test will lower the students grade. Second, the student could get sent to the principals' office and could get a call home. The students parents will also be upset. They would be in trouble at home and at school.

Second, If a student cheats on a proficiency test, it shows the teacher that the student doesn't know the material. For example, at the end of Spanish 1 you have to take a proficiency test. If the person you cheated off of doesn't know then, you fail and have to retake Spanish 1 again. For elementary it could be a spelling test. If they fail the spelling test they could also get a bad grade.

Last, the student could loose their teachers trust. The teacher would never let them seat next to a student during a test. Teachers trust is hard to gain back when you loose it. The students teacher will always keep their eye on the student that cheated. Those are the three good reasons why my lesson to the elementary students is important.
