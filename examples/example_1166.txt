The tenchnology had negative and positive effects on peple's lives, becuase not all people know how to use corretly. One of he positeve affects that tenchnology had is that pepole can get their onw ustuff without contacts with others people. But also this have negative effects on people lives, For examlpe had the limitation on humans contacts.

The limitation on humas contacts is one of the biges problem in the society . Every time the tenchonogy advance more and faster, and every time it is more involved in our life , changing the dynamismics of society constlanty.

This also afect people in many ways it can be said that it is a threat to humanity because is make them dependent.

For example people that how like to do all their work at home they do not like to contacts with others, people they just have contact with their self and on my opinion that is not a good way,because you need to had contacts with the other peoples to understand how to do the work or any question that they have.

People had developed tenchnology as an aid to civilize ,adquiere more knowledge ,expende their social relationships But some people misuse it and abuse it by killing and creating threats to humanity so the world could be in crisis.

In comclution , The tenchnology had a negative effect on the society just for people that who know how to use corretly or because they think that tenchnology is everyting and they can do everyting with the tenchnology .
