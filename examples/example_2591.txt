Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it?

I think is true that our selfs choose to make it be because one main reason is because nobody force us to do something we dont want to do we our selfs choose to do it or not do it, its all in our hands in making a decision and also in a decision we decide our personally in weather being a good person or being a bad person and also have to take in count if we are going to accept our consequences from our own decision of what we have choose to be and also how is going to show in our character as our personally around people and your family.

Do we choose our own character traits, or is our character form by influences beyond our control?

We choose our own character traits but we could be influences by other people and it our decision in weather doing what the rest of the people are doing and being influences by them we should take a position on the issue and to be influence but by our own selfs and not pretending who we are really not just because the rest of the people are doing it, it doesn't mean that we have to do it to it our choose and decision in weather doing it or not, we should be influences by our own form and beyond of our own control and letting nobody controlling us let live our own life.
