People have different skills. Some people have different skills In their own way your are special. Like practecticin,be pation and loaning a tik tok dance.

Practicing is important because. One example is when I learn how to play soccer. The person that teach me was my cousin Im still bad but Im learning. Another Example would be when

I learn how to bould on fornite. I learn how to bould and sauces by my cousin. Lastly when I learn how to aim on fornite. I learn because of my cousin and he teach me how. Learning a skill Is better then not to.

Being pation Is good for you for example. One time when I was trying to bould hard thing on fornite and it didn't work so i got mad. But then I tried doing net part by part and I got what I wanted. Another example would be I was Inpatient of swimming on deep water. But then I learn how to swim on deep water. When I wanted to go on a water park I was inpatient. But I learn be pation Is good. I was waiting then got in the park and it was fun. In some cases Is better to be pation then not to.

Loaning a tik tok daced for me Is a skill. For example one dace would when I made my own dance. It was easy and I lorn. Another example would be a hard danced. I tried to duet but it was to hard so I quit. Lastly would be A danced that was hard but

I did step by step and I enjoyed. Loaning can sometimes be fun.

Practecsin is the way to success. An example would be a hard assignment that I did and it was hard. Second would be pattion when I need to. For example when I play to much games Im pattion and not getting mad. Lastly learning fun skills. Hard daces can be challenging but once I lornet it was fun. Doing all of this thing made my skills useful In life and Im happy that I now all of this skills.
